# Unity Quick Start
1) Open `unity/EngineExperimentsUnity` in **Unity Hub**.
2) Save a scene as `Assets/Scenes/Demo.unity`.
3) Create: Plane (Ground), Cube (Player), Cube (Wall).
4) Add **Rigidbody** to Player; attach `Assets/Scripts/PlayerController.cs`.
5) UI: **GameObject → UI → Legacy → Text**; anchor top-left; drag Text into `hudText` on Player.
6) Play with WASD/Arrows; collisions increment on impact.
